# FiveFrames — Progress

Last updated: 2026-09-22

This file is current project state for a fresh implementation session, not a session log.
History and reasoning live in [docs/decisions.md](./decisions.md) (consequential decisions) and
git history (everything else). Update this file by rewriting it to match current reality, not by
appending narrative.

## Current phase

**Reconciliation pass complete (2026-09-22).** product.md was updated with the pre-purchase demo,
revised launch pricing (₱999 → ₱1,490 target), the 250-session event capacity boundary, expanded
signage deliverables, and guest trust cues. Architecture, decisions, and roadmap were reconciled
against those changes — see decisions D13 (event capacity: atomic counter, configurable cap) and
D14 (public demo: entirely client-side, no server storage). No code changed. The roadmap gained
two new slices (event capacity enforcement + trust cues; the public demo) and Slice 6's scope now
includes signage; slices 6–10 were renumbered to 6–12 to make room since none had started. Slices
1–5 are unaffected.

**Slice 5 — Gallery reveal, gallery link, visibility: complete.**

No schema change was needed — `reveal_mode`, `reveal_at`, `visibility`, `event_token`, and
`gallery_token` all already existed on `events` from Slice 1, and the host config form already
wrote to them. This slice added: the reveal-timing mechanism (`isGalleryRevealed()`); the public
`(gallery)/g/[token]` viewer route, gated on that plus `visibility`; and host-facing link
rotation/revocation for both the capture link and the gallery link. See decision D12 for how
"after the event" reveal is anchored mechanically. Slices 1–4 are unchanged and remain complete;
see prior verification records in git history if needed.

## What exists

- **Decisions D1–D14** ([decisions.md](./decisions.md)) — all **Accepted**, standing architecture.
  D12 records how "after the event" reveal timing is anchored to capture closing. D13/D14 (new in
  this reconciliation pass, not yet implemented) record the event-capacity counter mechanism and
  the client-only public demo.
- **Roadmap** ([roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)) — Slices 1–5 done, Slice 6 (event capacity enforcement
  and guest trust cues) next.
- **Vercel project** `five-frames` (org `ezanglos-projects`), linked via `.vercel/` (gitignored).
  Created ad hoc during this slice to get a real-HTTPS URL for device testing — the guest session
  cookie is `Secure`, which plain-HTTP LAN testing can't satisfy. Env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_
  SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`,
  `GUEST_SESSION_SECRET`) are set for both Preview and Production scopes, both pointing at the
  **dev** Supabase project. Live at `https://five-frames.vercel.app`.
  **Known interim state to reconcile before a real production launch:** because Vercel assigns a
  brand-new project's first deployment to Production regardless of intent, this Vercel project's
  Production environment currently serves the dev database, not a production one. Fine for
  continued device testing; must not be mistaken for a real production deployment later —
  Slice 6+ will need a genuine production Supabase project and Vercel env separation before this
  goes anywhere near real payments or guest data.
- **Schema (migration `20260921120000_guest_capture.sql`):** `guest_sessions` (event-scoped,
  display name); `captures` (`slot_index` 0–4 check constraint, partial unique index on
  `(guest_session_id, slot_index)` over live statuses, unique index on
  `(guest_session_id, reserve_key)`); the `reserve_capture()` Postgres function implementing the
  reserve step — row-locks the guest session, lazily expires abandoned reservations past their
  30-minute TTL, and is idempotent on `reserve_key`. RLS deny-all on both tables, same rationale
  as Slice 1. Private Storage bucket `captures` (no public read, `image/jpeg|png|webp|heic|heif`
  only). `supabase db advisors` shows only the pre-existing, unrelated
  `auth_leaked_password_protection` warning from Slice 1.
- **The frame-limit mechanism** (architecture §6, decisions D5/D6): `lib/dal/captures.ts` —
  `reserveCapture` re-checks the capture gate with a fresh event read, then calls
  `reserve_capture()`; `commitCapture` re-checks the gate again, refuses a lapsed reservation
  (checking `expires_at` directly, not just the `status` column, since the lazy sweep only runs
  inside `reserve_capture()` — see the regression note below), verifies the uploaded object
  before ever marking a frame consumed, and generates derivatives. Both are idempotent for their
  respective terminal states.
- **Guest identity:** `lib/auth/guest-session.ts` + `lib/auth/guest-session-token.ts` — our own
  httpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax signed cookie (decision D3), one cookie name per event token
  (HMAC-SHA256, `GUEST_SESSION_SECRET`), so one browser can hold sessions for multiple events.
  `lib/dal/guest-sessions.ts` scopes every query by `event_id`.
- **Media:** `lib/media/storage.ts` — signed upload URL minting (`createSignedUploadUrl`, now
  returning both the PUT `signedUrl` and the bare `token` used for TUS auth), commit-time
  object/mime verification, `sharp`-based display (1600px) and thumbnail (400px) derivative
  generation written as separate objects (invariant 10: original untouched), `createSignedReadUrl`
  for private delivery, and `getResumableUploadEndpoint()` deriving the TUS host from the same
  project URL every other Supabase client already uses. `lib/media/constants.ts` holds the bucket
  name and the 6MB resumable-upload threshold (D7) without a `server-only` import, so the client
  upload code can read them too.
- **Upload path (Slice 3, resolves D7's deferred threshold):** the client picks a standard
  signed-URL PUT below 6MB, or `tus-js-client` at or above it — Supabase's own recommended cutover
  point, same value as the fixed TUS chunk size. The TUS path authenticates via the
  `createSignedUploadUrl` token in the `x-signature` header, never the anon key or a session token
  (D3/D4 boundary holds). `tus-js-client`'s default fingerprint-based resume continues a
  re-selected file from its last successful chunk, including across a reload, which is what makes
  "connection drops mid-upload" cheap for large files beyond the reserve/commit gate itself.
- **Guest UI:** `app/(guest)/e/[token]/` — calm states for "event not found", "not open yet", and
  "capture has ended" (no guest-facing error tone); join form; `CaptureSlots` client component
  driving reserve → direct upload (PUT or TUS) → commit, with the client-generated `reserve_key`
  persisted to `localStorage` before the first request (survives a reload mid-attempt) and
  cleared only on a terminal outcome, resuming an in-flight reservation on return. Committed slots
  render their actual thumbnail (signed URL) with a download link to the original, not just a
  "Captured" placeholder.
- **Guest's own view (Slice 3, spec §8.3/§13, criteria 6 and 16-guest-half):**
  `listCapturesForGuestSessionWithUrls` (`lib/dal/captures.ts`) wraps the existing
  ownership-scoped query and mints signed thumbnail/download URLs only for committed captures —
  the query itself is the access check, the signed URL is its result, never a substitute (the same
  rule as everywhere else media is served). The "capture has ended" calm state now also loads and
  shows the guest's own captures when their session still exists, via the shared `OwnCaptures`
  component (`app/(guest)/e/[token]/own-captures.tsx`), instead of only the generic message.
- **Dev activation stand-in for payment** (architecture §13, roadmap Slice 2): `pnpm
  dev:activate-event <eventId>` (`scripts/activate-event-dev.ts`) sets `activated_at`,
  `capture_opened_at`, and issues `event_token`/`gallery_token` directly against the linked dev
  database. It is a standalone script, not a route or UI affordance in the app itself — there is
  no code path in the shipped app that can activate an event without payment (invariant 7 is
  intact). Real payment-driven activation is Slice 6.
- **Host dashboard and moderation (Slice 4, product.md §11.2, roadmap criteria 11/22/24):**
  `/events/[eventId]` (`app/(host)/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`) now also serves as the dashboard —
  guest-session and photo counts (`getEventCaptureStats`), a capture open/close control
  (`openCapture`/`closeCapture` in `lib/dal/events.ts`, gated by the new `canOpenCapture` helper
  in `lib/events/lifecycle.ts`: refuses to reopen once the automatic safety-net close has passed),
  and a gallery grid (`listCapturesForEventHost`, `GalleryGrid` client component) with
  hide/unhide/delete/favorite (`moderateCapture` in `lib/dal/captures.ts`). All four moderation
  and both capture-control functions verify event ownership via `getEventForHost` before touching
  anything, matching the existing ownership-predicate discipline. Moderation only ever writes
  `hidden_at`/`deleted_at`/`favorited_at` — never `slot_index` or `status` — so it can never free a
  slot or return a frame (product invariant 4); `listCapturesForGuestSession` now also excludes
  hidden/deleted rows, so moderated captures disappear from the guest's own view too (spec §8.3
  exception), without affecting which slots are considered occupied. The dashboard refreshes via
  a client-side `DashboardPoller` calling `router.refresh()` on an interval (decision D9 — polling,
  not realtime). `EVENT_LIFECYCLE_STATE_LABEL` in `lib/events/lifecycle.ts` is now the single
  source for lifecycle-state display text, shared by the dashboard list and the event page.
- **Gallery reveal, link, and visibility (Slice 5, product.md §7.3/§8, roadmap criteria 14–17):**
  `isGalleryRevealed()` (`lib/events/lifecycle.ts`, decision D12) derives reveal state from
  `reveal_mode`/`reveal_at` plus the existing lifecycle timestamps — never activated is never
  revealed; `immediate` reveals on activation; `after_event` (default) reveals once capture has
  closed; `custom` reveals at `reveal_at`. The public viewer lives at `(gallery)/g/[token]`
  (`app/(gallery)/`), resolved by `getEventByGalleryToken` (`lib/dal/events.ts`) — the gallery
  token is itself the credential, same pattern as the guest capture token, so there is no host
  ownership predicate on the lookup. The page is the one place that decides access: not found,
  `visibility === "only_me"`, and not-yet-revealed each render their own calm denial before any
  capture is ever loaded; only once access is granted does `listCapturesForGalleryViewer`
  (`lib/dal/captures.ts`) run, minting signed display-resolution URLs for committed,
  non-hidden, non-deleted captures only (the query is the access check, the signed URL is its
  result — same rule as every other media surface). The viewer shows images only, no download
  affordance — bulk/individual download is host-only and is Slice 8. Host dashboard link
  rotation/revocation (`rotateEventToken`/`revokeEventToken`/`rotateGalleryToken`/
  `revokeGalleryToken` in `lib/dal/events.ts`, `LinkRow` client component) is gated on
  `activated_at` — an unactivated (unpaid) event has nothing to rotate into existence (invariant
  7) — and rotation always mints a fresh token via the shared `generateLinkToken()`
  (`lib/auth/link-tokens.ts`, also now used by `scripts/activate-event-dev.ts`), immediately
  invalidating the old URL since every lookup is by exact token match. Copy-link uses
  `window.location.origin` client-side rather than a new base-URL env var.
- **Testing:** `lib/dal/captures.integration.test.ts` against the real linked dev Postgres and
  Storage — concurrent reserve storm (5 succeed, 6th exhausted, slots 0–4 exactly), duplicate
  reserve sharing one key (one row, one slot), retry-after-failed-upload (exactly one committed
  capture), abandoned-reservation TTL freeing its slot, a retry arriving after expiry reported as
  lapsed rather than revived, commit refused for a lapsed reservation, reserve/commit refused
  while capture is closed, the guest's own view returning signed thumbnail/download urls for a
  committed capture and null urls for a still-pending one, and (Slice 4) host moderation removing
  a capture from the guest's own view while a fresh reserve storm still only yields the remaining
  slots (never restoring the hidden/deleted one), moderation/stats scoped to the owning host only,
  `getEventCaptureStats` counting sessions and non-deleted committed photos, and capture
  open/close transitions including the "cannot reopen once the safety-net close has passed" rule,
  and (Slice 5) the gallery viewer excluding hidden/deleted captures while still showing a
  favorited one. `lib/dal/events.integration.test.ts` adds: rotating either token immediately
  invalidates the old one and a lookup by it returns null; revoking clears the column so no token
  resolves; rotate/revoke on another host's event is refused and leaves the real tokens
  unchanged; rotate/revoke before activation is refused. `lib/events/lifecycle.test.ts` adds unit
  coverage for `isGalleryRevealed()` across all three reveal modes, including the exact-instant
  boundary for `custom`. `lib/auth/guest-session-token.test.ts` — cookie signing round-trip,
  tamper rejection, cross-event rejection, wrong-secret rejection.

## Verification status

- `pnpm typecheck` — passing.
- `pnpm lint` — passing, no errors or warnings.
- `pnpm build` — passing; `/e/[token]`, `/events/[eventId]`, and `/g/[token]` register as dynamic
  routes.
- `pnpm test` (Vitest) — 47/47 passing, including the Slice 5 gallery-viewer and link-rotation
  integration tests above against the real dev database and storage bucket.
- **Slice 2 real-device validation — passed, reported 2026-09-21.** All 6 checklist items (iPhone
  Safari, Android Chrome, FB/Messenger/IG in-app browsers, interrupted upload, reload mid-attempt,
  HEIC) — see the historical record below. Still valid for the unchanged reserve/commit mechanism.
- **Slice 3 real-device validation — passed, reported 2026-09-21.** All 4 checklist items
  (interrupted upload over the resumable path, reload mid-upload, own-captures thumbnails/
  downloads, capture-ended own-view) — see below. Items 1–2 were this slice's roadmap exit
  condition.
- **Slice 4 has no device-dependent acceptance criteria** — the dashboard is a standard desktop/
  browser host UI (counts, a button, a gallery grid), fully exercised by the integration tests
  above and the automated checks. The roadmap's own verification for this slice ("Counts correct
  without realtime. Hidden and deleted captures disappear from the guest view. Moderation never
  restores a frame.") is what those tests assert directly. No manual device checklist is required
  to consider this slice complete; the UI itself has not been clicked through in a browser (this
  environment does not run browser automation) — see the optional recommended checks below.

## Regression protection added for human-found defects

One defect was caught by the integration tests themselves during implementation, before reaching
a human: the first version of `commitCapture` only checked the `status` column for "expired," but
that column is only updated lazily inside `reserve_capture()`, so a reservation whose TTL had
lapsed without a subsequent reserve call could still pass commit's gate. Fixed by having
`commitCapture` check `expires_at` directly against the current time, not just `status`. Covered
by "refuses to commit a lapsed reservation" in `lib/dal/captures.integration.test.ts`. No defects
were found during human verification.

## Manual verification results (Slice 2 exit condition) — all passed, 2026-09-21

Seeded via a draft event activated with `pnpm dev:activate-event <eventId>`, tested against the
Vercel deployment described above for real HTTPS.

1. **iPhone Safari** — pass. Full join → 5-capture flow completed.
2. **Android Chrome** — pass. Full join → 5-capture flow completed.
3. **Facebook/Messenger/Instagram in-app browsers** — pass. Picker opened and upload completed
   in each.
4. **Interrupted upload + retry** — pass. No duplicate capture, no lost frame.
5. **Reload mid-attempt** — pass. The persisted `reserve_key` correctly resumed the in-progress
   reservation rather than losing or duplicating it.
6. **HEIC on a real iPhone** — pass. Committed and produced a viewable JPEG derivative; resolves
   product.md §19's open question — no dedicated HEIC conversion step is needed, `sharp` handles
   it on the existing derivative path.

## Manual verification results (Slice 3 exit condition) — all passed, reported 2026-09-21

This is the roadmap's own verification for this slice ("Interrupted upload leaves the frame
available. Reload mid-upload yields a consistent state — committed or available, never both.").
Automated tests prove the reservation/commit mechanism honors this at the database level; these
four checks prove it holds in a real browser on a real network, which no automated test here can.

Seeded an active event the same way Slice 2 did (`pnpm dev:activate-event <eventId>`, tested
against the real-HTTPS Vercel deployment — the guest cookie is `Secure` and won't set over plain
HTTP).

1. **Interrupted upload is resumable, not lost** — pass. A photo at or above 6MB (the resumable
   threshold) was confirmed, the connection was killed mid-upload for several seconds, then
   restored. The upload continued rather than restarting or failing, and completed; the frame was
   never committed without the photo landing, and was never lost.
2. **Reload mid-upload leaves a consistent state** — pass. A large-photo attempt was reloaded
   mid-upload. After reload the slot correctly resolved to available-for-a-fresh-attempt or
   already-committed, never both and never stuck; re-selecting the same photo let the attempt
   finish rather than forcing a full restart.
3. **Own-captures thumbnails/downloads** — pass. Committed slots show the actual photo thumbnail
   with a working download link, not a placeholder.
4. **Capture-ended own-view** — pass. The event link after capture closed shows the "capture has
   ended" message plus the guest's own previously-committed captures with working downloads.

All four items passed; no failures to fix, so this slice's defect-to-regression policy does not
apply.

## Recommended (optional) manual check for Slice 5

Not a blocking exit condition — the roadmap's verification for this slice (gallery link before
reveal grants nothing, only-me visibility denies the link holder, rotated tokens stop working
immediately) is fully covered by the automated tests above, and this slice has no device-specific
acceptance criteria. If convenient, click through once in a browser as a sanity check:

1. On `/events/[eventId]` for an activated event, confirm the capture link and gallery link rows
   appear, "Copy link" copies a working absolute URL, and "Rotate"/"Revoke" update the shown link
   (or clear it) without a full page reload.
2. Set reveal to "Immediately," open the gallery link in a private/incognito window, and confirm
   captures appear. Switch visibility to "Only me" and confirm the same link now denies access.
3. Set reveal back to "After the event" with capture still open, and confirm the gallery link
   denies access until capture is closed.

## Next slice

**Slice 6 — Event join capacity enforcement and guest trust cues** ([roadmap](./roadmap.md)). Not
started. (Payment and activation, expanded with event signage, is now Slice 7.)
